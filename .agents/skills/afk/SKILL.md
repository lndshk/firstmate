description: Enter away-mode supervision. Use when the user invokes /afk (e.g. "/afk", "/afk back in an hour", "going afk"). Sets a durable away-mode flag so the sub-supervisor daemon can self-handle routine wakes and escalate only captain-relevant events as one batched digest, cutting supervision token cost during walk-away stretches. Exit is automatic; any real (unmarked) message returns to full per-wake responsiveness.

# afk

Away-mode supervision. When invoked, `/afk` makes the daemon's token-saving
tradeoff **consented** and **explicit**: the captain is stepping away, so the
sub-supervisor may triage routine wakes in bash instead of waking firstmate's
LLM for each one. Escalations still reach the captain — but as one pre-read,
batched digest rather than per-wake injections.

## What it does

1. **Set the durable away-mode flag:**
   ```sh
   date '+%s' > state/.afk
   ```
   This file survives a firstmate restart: recovery (§5) re-enters afk if the
   flag is present.

2. **Ensure the sub-supervisor daemon is running.** Check the pid file; start
   the daemon only if it is dead or absent:
   ```sh
   if [ -f state/.supervise-daemon.pid ] && kill -0 "$(cat state/.supervise-daemon.pid)" 2>/dev/null; then
     : # daemon already alive — it picks up the flag on its next cycle
   else
     nohup bin/fm-supervise-daemon.sh >/dev/null 2>&1 &
   fi
   ```
   The daemon is **presence-gated**: it injects escalations only while
   `state/.afk` exists, and stays quiet otherwise.

3. **Do not separately arm `fm-watch.sh`.** The daemon manages the watcher as
   its child; the singleton lock no-ops a stray arm harmlessly.

4. **Acknowledge** to the captain that away-mode is active: the daemon will
   self-handle routine wakes, escalate only captain-relevant events, and the
   captain can exit by sending any real message.

## How to exit afk

No `/back` is needed. The first genuine message is the return signal:

- A message **without** the sentinel marker and **not** starting with `/afk`
  → the captain is back. Clear `state/.afk`, stop the daemon, flush one
  distilled "while you were out" catch-up (drain `state/.wake-queue`, summarize
  any pending escalations from `state/.subsuper-escalations` and any
  `state/.subsuper-inject-wedged` marker), and resume full per-wake
  responsiveness (arm `bin/fm-watch.sh`).
- A message **with** the sentinel marker (`FM_INJECT_MARK`, ASCII 0x1f) → it
  is a daemon escalation; stay afk and process it.
- Re-invoking `/afk` while already away → stay afk (refresh the flag); this
  does **not** trigger an exit.

Bias ambiguous cases toward exit: a present captain beats token savings, and
a false exit is self-correcting (the captain re-runs `/afk`).

## Orthogonal to approval authority

afk changes how aggressively firstmate surfaces things, **not who approves
what**. "Away" never means "approves more." A PR ready for merge, a
needs-decision finding, or anything destructive still waits for the captain's
explicit word — the daemon just batches the notification.

## Sentinel marker contract

The daemon prefixes every injection with `FM_INJECT_MARK` (ASCII unit
separator, 0x1f) — invisible and untypable. This is how firstmate tells a
daemon escalation apart from a real message in the same pane. The marker
travels with the message text; it does not rely on harness-level
typed-vs-injected detection (which is not portable across claude, codex,
opencode, and pi).

## Busy-guard and composer guard

The daemon never injects into an in-use pane. Two checks run before every
injection (shared with `fm-send.sh` via `bin/fm-tmux-lib.sh`):

- **`pane_is_busy`** — the harness shows a busy footer (agent mid-turn).
- **`pane_input_pending`** — the cursor line holds real unsubmitted text (a
  human's half-typed line, or a previous injection whose Enter was swallowed).
  The detector **strips the harness's composer box borders first**, so an idle
  *bordered* composer (claude draws `│ > … │`) is correctly read as empty, not
  pending. Without this, every idle claude pane looked like pending input and
  the daemon deferred 100% of escalations (incident afk-invx-i5).
  `FM_COMPOSER_IDLE_RE` still overrides empty-composer matching after border
  stripping.

Either condition defers the injection; the buffered escalation survives in
`state/.subsuper-escalations` and is retried on the next housekeeping tick. In
afk mode the composer guard is belt-and-suspenders (no human is typing), but it
protects against the race window between the captain returning and their
message landing, and against the daemon's own previous injection sitting unsent.

**Max-defer escape (the daemon must never silently wedge).**
If anything stays buffered past `FM_MAX_DEFER_SECS` (default 300), the daemon
attempts one normal flush, which still requires an idle pane and empty composer.
If that submit cannot be confirmed, it raises a loud, rate-limited wedge alarm:
an ERROR in the daemon log, a durable
`state/.subsuper-inject-wedged` marker (surface it on the "while you were out"
catch-up if present), and a flash on the supervisor client's status line.
So a guard false-positive becomes a visible stall, never an unbounded silent no-op.

## Submit model

The digest is typed **once** via `send-keys -l`, then submitted with Enter and
**verified**: Enter is retried (Enter only, never a retype) until the composer
clears.
A submit "landed" only when the composer is confirmed empty afterward, using
the same corrected, border-aware detector as the composer guard.
A bordered-empty claude composer is recognized as submitted rather than
mistaken for a swallowed Enter.
`fm-send.sh` uses the same primitive and exits non-zero
when a steer's Enter is positively swallowed, so firstmate learns an instruction
did not land instead of leaving it unsubmitted.

## Classification policy (per wake)

- `signal` whose status content has no captain-relevant verb
  (`done:|needs-decision:|blocked:|failed:|PR ready|checks green|ready in branch|merged`)
  → **self-handle**. Captain-relevant verb → escalate.
- `check` → always escalate (check scripts print only when firstmate should wake).
- `stale` annotated `(no live agent process)` → escalate on the wake. A dead
  agent is not transient staleness: the process is gone, it cannot resume, and
  the watcher reports it once per task generation, so deferring it to the
  persistence recheck would lose it outright once the window itself disappears.
- `stale` with a terminal status → escalate. Non-terminal stale is transient: the
  daemon records a marker and self-handles; if the pane is still idle past
  `FM_STALE_ESCALATE_SECS` (default 240s), housekeeping escalates it as a possible
  wedge. This bounds wedge-detection latency to the threshold plus a tick - a
  delay, never a loss - and healthy crewmates (which are autonomous and do not
  wait on firstmate mid-task) are unaffected.
- `heartbeat` → self-handle; the daemon runs its own cheap bash fleet scan every
  `FM_HEARTBEAT_SCAN_SECS` (default 300s) as the catch-all for a captain-relevant
  status line the per-wake classifier might miss.
- Unknown reason, or any uncertainty → **escalate (fail-safe)**.

`FM_INJECT_SKIP` (default `heartbeat`) force-self-handles matching kinds,
overriding classification - use sparingly.

## Escalation format

Escalations are buffered up to `FM_ESCALATE_BATCH_SECS` (default 90s; 0 =
immediate) and flushed as ONE single-line digest prefixed with the sentinel
marker, carrying the pre-read status summaries and a recommended action.
Embedded newlines are collapsed to a literal separator before injection.

The single-line format and the marker solve the same problem as the busy-guard
(the daemon and the captain share one input channel): the digest is one
unambiguous submission regardless of TUI, and firstmate can tell it apart from a
real message. This is why fewer, cheaper firstmate turns handle the same fleet.

## Remaining injection hardening

- **Marker strip** - `strip_injection_marker` removes the sentinel prefix before
  classification/relay, so the digest text firstmate sees is clean.
- **Portable singleton lock** - the daemon uses the repo's mkdir-based lock
  helper (`fm-wake-lib.sh`) instead of `flock`, which is absent on macOS.
- **Dedupe across signal/stale/scan** - `classify_signal` and `classify_stale`
  both check the seen-status marker before escalating, so a status escalated by
  one path is not re-escalated by another in the same digest.
- **Auto-discovered supervisor pane** - the daemon resolves its injection target
  from `FM_SUPERVISOR_TARGET`, then `$TMUX_PANE` (inherited from the pane that
  launched it), then a `firstmate:0` fallback with a warning; the resolution
  source is logged at startup so a wrong-but-resolving fallback is detectable.
- **Dim ghost text** - the composer detector also drops dim/faint (SGR 2) runs
  before the border strip, so a claude prompt-suggestion ghost never reads as
  pending input (incident composer-robust). `FM_BUSY_REGEX` overrides busy footers.

## Reliability properties (must hold)

Nothing is lost (the durable wake queue plus `fm-wake-drain.sh` recover any
missed or crashed injection); wedge detection is bounded-latency, not lossy; the
catch-all scan backs up the keyword classifier; and the daemon preserves its
single-instance portable lock, crash-loop backoff, a pane-gone guard, and a
signal-trapped shutdown that flushes buffered escalations before exit.
