# fm-tmux-lib.sh — shared tmux pane primitives for firstmate.
#
# ONE source of truth for: busy detection, composer-empty (pending-input)
# detection, agent process-tree liveness, Codex safety-prompt clearing, and a
# verify-and-retry-Enter submit.
# Sourced by the watcher, the away-mode daemon (bin/fm-supervise-daemon.sh), and
# bin/fm-send.sh so the pane/composer logic cannot drift between callers.
#
# Why this exists (incident afk-invx-i5): the daemon's old composer check only
# recognized a BARE prompt glyph ("> ") as an empty composer. claude draws its
# input box with box-drawing borders ("│ > … │"), so every idle claude pane read
# as "pending input" and the away-mode daemon deferred 100% of escalations for
# 9.5 hours with no escape. The detector below strips the box borders before
# deciding, so a bordered-but-empty composer is correctly seen as empty. The same
# corrected detector backs the submit acknowledgement (a submit "landed" iff the
# composer is empty afterward), fixing the parallel false "Enter swallowed".
#
# Ghost text (incident composer-robust): claude renders a predicted-next-prompt
# "suggestion" as dim/faint text inside an otherwise-empty composer. A plain
# capture cannot tell it apart from text a human typed, so the old reader saw an
# idle pane as holding pending input and the daemon deferred injection / firstmate
# misjudged the pane. The composer reader now captures just the cursor line WITH
# ANSI styling (tmux capture-pane -e), drops dim/faint (SGR 2) runs, and decides on
# what is left, so ghost/placeholder text never counts as real input. The styled
# capture is consumed internally and parsed into a boolean here; it is NEVER
# surfaced (fm-peek and every human/LLM-facing path stay plain), and only the
# single composer row is captured, so no escape-laden pane bulk is produced. This
# is harness-generic: any harness that dims placeholder/ghost text benefits.
#
# Per-harness override: FM_COMPOSER_IDLE_RE matches an empty composer after
# dim-ghost and structural border stripping. FM_BUSY_REGEX overrides the busy
# footer set (mirrors fm-watch.sh / the daemon).
#
# All functions are `set -u` and `set -e` safe (guarded tmux calls, explicit
# returns) so they can be sourced into either context.
