# Send one line of literal text to a crewmate window, then Enter.
# Usage: fm-send.sh <window> <text...>
#   <window> may be a bare firstmate window name (fm-xyz), resolved through
#   this home's state/<id>.meta, or explicit session:window.
# Special keys instead of text: fm-send.sh <window> --key Escape   (or Enter, C-c, ...)
#
# Text submission is verified: the line is typed ONCE, then Enter is sent and
# retried (Enter only, never retyped) until the composer clears. If a swallowed
# Enter is positively confirmed (the sent text is still sitting in the composer
# after all retries), fm-send exits NON-ZERO so the caller knows the steer did not
# land instead of silently leaving an unsubmitted instruction (incident
# afk-invx-i5). Some WSL-hosted Windows-agent panes report the cursor row as
# pending after a submit that actually landed; an ambiguous pending read whose
# composer no longer holds the sent text is downgraded to a warning + success
# after one longer settle, so a phantom pending never turns a real steer into an
# error. The composer/submit logic is shared with the away-mode daemon via
# bin/fm-tmux-lib.sh. Tune with FM_SEND_RETRIES (default 3) / FM_SEND_SLEEP (0.4)
# and FM_SEND_AMBIGUOUS_SETTLE (default 1.5).
