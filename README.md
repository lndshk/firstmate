You can run one coding agent easily.
But the moment you want three project tasks done in parallel - fixes, investigations, plans, audits - you become a tab-juggler: babysitting sessions, copy-pasting context between repos, forgetting which terminal had the failing test.

firstmate flips the model.
You talk to a single agent - the first mate - and it runs the crew for you: spawning autonomous agents in tmux windows, giving each a clean git worktree, supervising them to completion, and handing you finished PRs, approved local merges, or standalone investigation reports.
For larger fleets, you can opt in to persistent secondmates: domain supervisors that are still ordinary direct reports, but run from their own isolated firstmate homes.
There is no app to install; the whole orchestrator is an `AGENTS.md` file that any terminal coding agent can follow.

- **One liaison** - you never talk to a worker agent.
  The first mate dispatches, supervises, escalates only real decisions, and reports plain outcomes about work that is ready, blocked, or needs your call.
- **A visible crew** - every crewmate lives in a tmux window.
  Watch any of them work, or type into their window to intervene; the first mate reconciles.
- **Persistent domain supervisors** - route natural-language scopes through `data/secondmates.md` when a domain deserves its own long-lived supervisor.
  Each secondmate has a separate `FM_HOME`, local state, local projects, and its own session lock, while the main first mate still supervises it like any other direct report.
- **Guarded by construction** - the first mate is read-only over your projects except for clean local default-branch refreshes, safe pruning of local branches whose remote is gone, and approved `local-only` fast-forward merges; crewmates work in disposable [treehouse](https://github.com/kunchenguid/treehouse) worktrees.
  Ship tasks follow each project's delivery mode, and scout tasks produce local reports without pushing anything.

This is not an agent harness. This is not a skill. This is not a CLI.

This is.. a directory that turns any agent into your firstmate, and you the captain.

## Quick Start

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/kunchenguid/firstmate && cd firstmate
$ claude   # launch your agent harness here; AGENTS.md takes over

> ahoy! look at my github project xyz, then fix the flaky login test and add dark mode

# firstmate checks its toolchain (asking your consent before installing anything),
# clones the project under projects/, and spawns two crewmates in tmux windows
# fm-fix-login-k3 and fm-dark-mode-p7.
# Minutes later:

  PR ready for review, captain: https://github.com/you/xyz/pull/42
  (fix flaky login test - risk: low - CI green)

> alright merge it
```

## Install

**Prerequisites** (the first mate detects everything else and offers to install it):

```sh
# 1. a verified agent harness - claude, codex, opencode, or pi
# 2. git + GitHub auth
# 3. tmux - the crew lives in tmux windows (firstmate offers to install it if missing)
gh auth login
```

**Get firstmate:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kunchenguid/firstmate
cd firstmate && claude
```

That is the whole install.
On first launch the first mate detects what its required toolchain is missing or too old (tmux, node, gh, treehouse with durable lease support, no-mistakes, gh-axi, chrome-devtools-axi, lavish-axi), lists it with the exact install commands, and installs only after you say go.
If compatible `tasks-axi` is already on `PATH`, bootstrap records it as an optional capability fact and firstmate uses its verbs for routine backlog mutations; when it is absent or incompatible, firstmate keeps hand-editing `data/backlog.md` exactly as before.

**Run it inside tmux for the best experience.**
firstmate works from any terminal - outside tmux, crewmates land in a detached `firstmate` session you can attach to - but launching your harness from inside tmux puts every crewmate window in your own session, one per task, where you can watch the crew work in real time or type into any window to intervene.

## How It Works

```

- **Event-driven supervision** - a zero-token bash watcher (`bin/fm-watch.sh`) sleeps on the fleet and wakes the first mate only when a crewmate reports, stalls, a PR merges, or an internal heartbeat review is due.
  A complementary always-on shell supervisor (`bin/fm-supervisor.sh`) reconciles durable wakes without consuming them, classifies recorded direct reports, writes a machine-readable snapshot, and refreshes the Firstmate Board without injecting chat or spending LLM tokens.
  Detected wakes are also written to a durable local queue (`state/.wake-queue`) before detector state advances, so a missed one-shot process exit can be recovered by draining the queue.
  Each normal watcher start also ensures one singleton keepalive sidecar is running; the sidecar judges liveness by `state/.last-watcher-beat` age and silently re-arms the one-shot watcher when the beacon goes stale and no live watcher owns the watch lock.
  The sidecar is bound to in-flight work: it only spawns while a task exists (`state/*.meta`), and it stops cleanly and stops re-arming once the fleet empties, so a torn-down or ended session never leaves a task-less watcher enqueueing heartbeats with no consumer.
  Routine watcher polling, restarts, elapsed waiting time, and unchanged heartbeat reviews stay silent; an idle crew costs you nothing.
  A pull-based guard (`bin/fm-guard.sh`) warns through supervision tool output if tasks are in flight and that watcher stops running, queued wakes are waiting to be drained, or a read-only stall sweep (`bin/fm-stall-check.sh`) finds dormant workstreams - finished-but-not-advanced tasks, queued items whose blockers or date gates have cleared, in-flight crews whose committed work is not pushed to any remote, idle in-flight panes, or an idle domain advisor that finished its routed work.
  A presence-gated sub-supervisor (`bin/fm-supervise-daemon.sh`) extends this for walk-away supervision: the `/afk` skill activates it, after which it self-handles routine wakes in bash and escalates only captain-relevant events as one batched, single-line digest (prefixed with an in-band sentinel marker so firstmate can tell daemon injections apart from real messages).
  Its injection path shares `bin/fm-tmux-lib.sh` with `fm-send.sh`, so dim-ghost-aware and border-aware composer detection plus verified submit retry stay consistent; stalled escalation delivery raises `state/.subsuper-inject-wedged` after `FM_MAX_DEFER_SECS` instead of silently deferring forever.
- **Worktrees, not branches in your checkout** - crewmates never touch your clone; treehouse pools clean worktrees so parallel tasks on one repo cannot collide.
- **Two task shapes** - ship tasks change projects and ship by project mode (`no-mistakes`, `direct-PR`, or `local-only`); scout tasks investigate, plan, reproduce bugs, or audit, then leave a report at `data/<id>/report.md` and never push.
- **Advisory direct work** - each firstmate home normally keeps at most three ordinary ship/scout reports active, while persistent secondmates remain outside that budget.
  New work stays queued by default when three are active, but the captain may explicitly override the guidance for a particular dispatch; `fm-spawn.sh` does not enforce a hard cap.
- **Optional secondmates** - `data/secondmates.md` records persistent domain supervisors with natural-language scopes, project clone lists, and home paths.
  `fm-home-seed.sh` provisions the isolated home, clones the listed PR-based projects into it, initializes newly cloned `no-mistakes` projects, copies the charter to `data/charter.md`, and `fm-spawn.sh --secondmate` launches it through the same tmux and status-file path as any direct report.
  When seeded with `-`, the home is a durable treehouse lease under the secondmate id, so it survives with no live process and is not recycled by later `treehouse get` or pruning.
  Retirement or seed rollback returns the leased home; normal restart/recovery keeps it leased.
  If returning the lease fails during teardown, firstmate leaves the route and home intact instead of hiding a still-held lease.
  Seeding is transactional: if validation, cloning, initialization, or registry update fails, generated briefs, new homes, new project clones, and registry edits are rolled back.
  `local-only` projects stay with the main first mate because they merge into the main local checkout instead of a remote-backed PR path.
  The same project may appear in multiple secondmate homes when their scopes differ, such as issue triage versus feature development.
  Secondmates are idle by default: after startup recovery reconciles only work already in their own home, an empty queue waits silently for routed tasks, and they never self-initiate surveys or audits.
  After seeding a secondmate, `fm-backlog-handoff.sh` moves already-judged in-scope queued items from the main backlog into that secondmate home so the domain queue starts in the right place.
  Idle secondmate panes are healthy; teardown is explicit and refuses while the secondmate home has in-flight work unless the captain has approved discard with `--force`.
- **Project modes are explicit** - `data/projects.md` records each project's delivery mode and optional `+yolo` autonomy flag.
  `no-mistakes` projects run the full validation pipeline, `direct-PR` projects open PRs without that pipeline, and `local-only` projects stay local until firstmate performs an approved fast-forward merge.
- **Project memory belongs to projects** - durable project-intrinsic agent knowledge lives in each project's committed `AGENTS.md`, with `CLAUDE.md` as a symlink.
  Ship briefs prompt crewmates to create or update those files through the normal delivery path; `data/projects.md` stays a thin private registry.
- **Local clones stay fresh** - bootstrap and PR-based teardown refresh remote-backed project clones with clean default-branch fast-forwards when the clone is on the default branch and has no local work, and prune local branches whose remote is gone and that no worktree still needs.
- **Self-updates stay safe** - `/updatefirstmate` fast-forwards the running firstmate repo and registered secondmate homes from `origin`, activates the main home's current deterministic supervisor, then re-reads updated instructions and nudges updated secondmates without touching project clones.
  The update is fast-forward only: dirty, diverged, offline, and off-default targets are reported and left untouched.
- **Restart-proof** - all state lives in tmux, status files, local markdown under `data/`, `data/secondmates.md`, and persistent secondmate homes.
  Every incoming request is recorded in the local backlog before clarification, routing, or dispatch, so later messages and restarts do not silently drop it.
  Kill the first mate session anytime; the next one reconciles and carries on.

## The bin/ toolbelt

The first mate drives these; you rarely need to, but they work by hand too.

## Configuration

The shared orchestrator behavior lives in `AGENTS.md` - edit it like any prompt when the fleet is empty, or dispatch shared-repo edits to a crewmate while tasks are in flight.
The tracked `.tasks.toml` pins the optional `tasks-axi` markdown backend to `data/backlog.md`, with `done_keep = 10` and an archive at `data/done-archive.md`.
When compatible `tasks-axi` is on `PATH`, firstmate uses its verbs for routine backlog mutations and keeps secondmate transfers behind `fm-backlog-handoff.sh` validation; without it, backlog bookkeeping remains manual.
Compatible means the shared bootstrap probe accepts `tasks-axi --version` as 0.1.1 or newer.
Personal preferences for one captain's fleet live locally in `data/captain.md`; it is gitignored and read after `data/projects.md` and optional `data/secondmates.md` during bootstrap.
Persistent secondmate routes live locally in `data/secondmates.md`.
Each line records the secondmate id, charter summary, absolute home path, natural-language scope, project clone list, and added date; `fm-home-seed.sh validate` refuses duplicate ids, duplicate homes, and nested or overlapping homes.
The main first mate routes by reading those scopes with judgment; the project list is provisioning data, not exclusive ownership.
Use `fm-home-seed.sh <id> - <project>...` to lease a fresh firstmate worktree for the secondmate home.
The lease is held under the secondmate id until explicit retirement or seed rollback returns it, so normal restarts do not free or recycle the home.
Teardown of a leased home fails closed if `treehouse return` cannot release the lease; plain-clone homes with no treehouse pool slot are removed directly.
Secondmate routes cover `no-mistakes` and `direct-PR` projects; `local-only` projects remain main-firstmate work.
For `no-mistakes` projects, seeding initializes only projects newly cloned into a secondmate home and refuses to mutate a preexisting clone that is not already initialized.
After creating a secondmate, move existing main-backlog items that you have judged in-scope with `fm-backlog-handoff.sh <secondmate-id> <item-key>...`; it is idempotent and refuses in-flight items or non-secondmate homes.
Set `FM_SECONDMATE_CHARTER` to seed from inline charter text when no filled charter brief exists; set `FM_SECONDMATE_SCOPE` when the routing scope should differ from the charter text.
`FM_HOME` selects the operational home for one firstmate instance.
When it is unset, the repo root is the home; when it is set, scripts still run from this repo's `bin/`, but `state/`, `data/`, `config/`, and `projects/` come from `$FM_HOME`.
Harness support is a table in section 4: claude, codex, opencode, and pi are all empirically verified; new harnesses get verified through a supervised trial task before joining the table.

```

### Always-on supervisor runbook

Bootstrap silently starts the main home's supervisor when tmux is available; secondmate homes do not start another owner.
Self-update ensures the post-update main-home supervisor is active; use `bin/fm-supervisor.sh start` to ensure it is running during manual recovery, `restart` to replace a verified stale owner, and `status` to inspect its singleton PID, heartbeat, snapshot freshness, and last error.
The running cadence is persisted in `state/.firstmate-supervisor.owner` and governs heartbeat health checks.
These commands are safe to run immediately after merge; `start` is idempotent and `restart` refuses duplicate ownership.

The snapshot is `state/firstmate-supervisor.tsv`, current actionable conditions appear in its escalation records and the generated board, and their durable history appends to `state/.firstmate-supervisor.escalations`.
The authoritative state-classification and optional receipt-deadline contract is in the [supervision protocol](AGENTS.md#8-supervision-protocol).
The supervisor never drains Firstmate's wake queue, changes the backlog, or sends chat, so normal ownership and AFK batching/injection remain unchanged.

## Development

Tracked changes to firstmate itself, including `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.tasks.toml`, `.github/workflows/`, `bin/`, and agent skill files, ship through the `no-mistakes` pipeline on a feature branch and require the captain's explicit merge approval.
When supervising live crewmates, keep long validation or build work in the background so watcher wakes can still be handled.
Human-authored pull requests targeting `main` must be raised through `git push no-mistakes`; see `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the enforced contributor workflow.
Local `.no-mistakes/` state and test evidence stay out of this repo; `.no-mistakes.yaml` keeps evidence in a temp directory instead.
The watcher reliability path keeps the one-shot reason-line process model, durable queue, singleton lock, and a beacon-based keepalive sidecar.
The presence-gated sub-supervisor (`bin/fm-supervise-daemon.sh`) provides proactive wake routing for walk-away supervision via the `/afk` skill; a blocking-waiter split remains a deferred follow-up phase.
